# Reflection

## Implemented

### TO DO:

🎯 Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).

🎯 Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned).

🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.

🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.
