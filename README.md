# Reflection

## Implemented

### TO DO:

~~Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).~~
Used 768px as a media query breakpoint for larger screens.

~~Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned).~~

- Header changes from flex-direction: row, to flex-direction: column, so that the branding and the navigation both fit on smaller screens.
- Close Image button is displayed under the image closer to thumbs on mobile device -> when the screen size is larger, the button gets removed from the document flow and positioned absolutely, to keep the featured image title and text bar 'sleeker'

🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.

DONE
🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.
