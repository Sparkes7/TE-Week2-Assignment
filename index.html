              The once-dark expanse of our planet has given way to a
              breathtaking spectacle of lights, a testament to the relentless
              march of human progress. As night falls, the world transforms into
              a dazzling canvas of urbanization, industrialization, and
              technological advancements. From the twinkling city skylines to
              the sprawling metropolises, the night sky is ablaze with the
              collective presence of humanity.

            <h3>The Cost of Progression</h3>
            <p class="about-info-paragraph">
              Human progression has brought about numerous benefits, including
              advancements in technology, medicine, and quality of life.
              However, this progress has come at a significant cost to the
              planet. Our relentless pursuit of growth and development has led
              to the degradation of natural ecosystems, exploitation of
              resources, and devastating environmental consequences.
